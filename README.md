# Cinephile

This is a react project which enlists movie titles based on search query. The app shows a default list of my favorite slasher thriller by the name "Saw". Results are shown when the user enters movie titles they are looking for. API used to retrive results is [http://www.omdbapi.com/]. Built using plain css, semantic-ui-react components and react. Clone and run yarn start to see it in action. Watch it in action - https://cinephile-movie-app.herokuapp.com/
